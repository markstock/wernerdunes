Application of Werner's algorithm to modeling of wind-blown dunes

![dunes dem example](example2.png?raw=true "Example of output, digital elevation model of virtual sand dunes")

## Build and run
With GCC, Eigen3, and libpng installed on a Linux machine, this should be as simple as

	make
	./werner.bin -o out
	./werner.bin -h
